# Enclosures

In a lab-environment, it would be a good idea to use an enclosure for the arduino that ensured good connections for all pins and cables, as well as protection from potential dirt contaminations. There are a couple of enclosures available off the shelf, but, in my opinion, it is hard to find a fully satisfying solution. More likely, one need to customize the available products.

## Arduino specific enclosures

* [duinoCases](http://www.duinocases.com/product-category/arduino-enclosures/)
Very well build at a small size form factor. Replacement [rear panels](http://www.duinocases.com/store/optional-panels/rear-panel-blank-metal-blue/) could be purchased and used to built custom connector interfaces. However, the space is limited, and the way the cover needs to be attached makes it difficult to work on the wiring inside the enclosure.

* [IAASR](http://www.iaasr.com/product/custom-arduino-enclosure/)
Larger in size, but very versatile enclosure. It comes with sufficient space to place a breadboard inside next to the arduino board.

* [Electronics-Salon Rail Mount](http://www.electronics-salon.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=54717)
Not an actual enclosure, but a neat way to connect the arduino board to a rigid terminal block.

* [KKSB-Cases](https://www.kksb-cases.com/kksb-arduino-metal-project-case.html)
This cases look nice and fancy, but they do not really offer much to interface sturdy and robust connections. All you can doo is run loose wires through the slit.

* [Arduino Uno prototyping enclosure kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/mjrice/arduino-uno-prototyping-enclosure-kit/)

Similar as the ISAAR design, but in acrylic. Size is large enough to drill holes for several connectors.

## General enclosure design

Switch boxes are a nice alternative solution to find metal enclosures that come already with connectors built in. All that is needed is to find a way to place the arduino board inside..
