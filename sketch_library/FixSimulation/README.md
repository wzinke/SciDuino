# FixSimulation

In order to set up eye tracking systems the Arduino is used to simulate on a very basic level eye movements by generating an analog output within a specified range.

## SimpleFix

Longer fixations at a central spot with shorter random fixations in the periphery

## NinePoint

Randomly keeps the fixation at nine potential points.
